The Catalyst:
The Catalyst Collective was founded based on the belief in empowerment — we wanted to empower our 
youths to become active changemakers in Singapore’s mental health landscape. The same concept 
applies here, albeit with a slight difference: the power to rewrite our own narratives.

Coincidentally, the catalyst is also one of the weapons that mages can wield to use their magic in Fantasy 
RPG! Therefore, be it a youth ground-up initiative or a magical book, its symbolism is reflective of the 
journal that the user is entrusted with. Hence, “The Catalyst”!
