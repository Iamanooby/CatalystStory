  - "Are you also here to eliminate me? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2026"
  - All I ever wanted is to be like all of you. To have friends I can laugh with.
    To go on exciting adventures. To be a normal boy.
  - "Yet, I was treated badly by the townspeople for being \u201Cdifferent\u201D.
    Day after day, I cried myself to sleep. It was until I met the Crystal Expedition
    Team that I was finally saved..."
  - They were the only ones who showed me kindness and accepted me for who I am.
    But they, too, are gone after we destroyed the crystals.
  - "\u2026 I thought that the townsfolk would accept me after saving Mythshield
    but they\u2026 They threw me out because they became more afraid of me."
  - "Why\u2026 Why did I even volunteer to destroy the crystals? *A crystal shard
    around Kuro begins to glow forebodingly."
  - "\u2026 No\u2026 There\u2019s nothing you can do to stop my pain! Get away from
    me!"
